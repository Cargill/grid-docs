Grid Schema provides a way to define the structure for a Grid item such as a
Product or Location in a standard, reusable way. This ensures consistency when
storing and exchanging Grid entities.

Grid Schema is integral to the operation of Grid components that store and
retrieve properties that are defined at runtime. Schemas are also integrated
with Pike Organizations and Agents to allow for fine-grained control over who
can add or modify a Schema.
